/**
 * i_serial_port.h
 * ============================================================
 * Combined abstract interface for a full-duplex serial port.
 *
 * Inherits both i_serial_reader and i_serial_writer, and adds
 * lifecycle management (open / close / flush / drain) plus
 * configuration inspection.
 *
 * Design notes (SOLID):
 *  • Open/Closed  – New transports (e.g. USB-CDC, SPI-UART bridge)
 *    implement this interface without modifying existing code.
 *  • Liskov       – Any i_serial_port implementation can substitute
 *    for any other without changing the consumer's behaviour.
 *  • Dependency Inversion – High-level components (e.g. gnss_controller)
 *    depend on this abstraction, not on serial_port (concrete class).
